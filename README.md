# Lunatic Rave 2 Score Scraper 
## [Live Version](https://lr2ir-top-scores.herokuapp.com/)

This app scrapes score data from Lunatic Rave 2's Score Database website. It then cleans and formats the scraped HTML data into a readable pandas dataframe format. 

Users can view the top rankings for any song from a song file or by searching for them. The app will dynamically plot a top 25 scores graph for any ranking page using Matplotlib's data visualization methods.

It also supports several tables and has links to view the charts themselves. The intended goal was to be able to view charts for BMS songs faster than having to open BeMusicSeeker.
